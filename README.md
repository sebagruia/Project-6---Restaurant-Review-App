# Restaurant Review App
---

## Project Description

This App was created to give the users the possibility to review different restaurants in New York City, also the user can search the restaurants based on different filters like cuisine or/and neighborhood.
According to the filter selection, the app will display a list of restaurants and each restaurant position on the map.

## Installation

*  Create a directory in the location where you want to install the app

* run -> git init

* run -> git clone

* You need to start a server at port 8000. 
   * You can follow the next method to acheive this: In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with       python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have      Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
    Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python -m http.server 8000.
